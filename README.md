# Thoughts

### day 01

Part I: decided to sort both lists and then linearly iterate through them.

Part II: instead of adjusting part I, SQL seemed a better fit. So I loaded the data in sqlite (in-memory) en got the result in a single sql query.

### day 02

Part I: iterate through each row, tracking the previous value and previous difference.

Part II: first tried an improvement of part I, thinking I only needed to track the number of decrease/increase-flips and an extra previous difference. But too many exceptional scenario's popped in my head. Switched to brute force: for each row, remove each level and reduce to part I.

### day 03

Part I: just went for a regex with capturing groups. Hadn't done these in python yet, googled to find `re.findall` just returns the capturing groups. Multiplying and summing the result screamed 'map-reduce' to me, and I learned python has `map` and `reduce` out of the box. Nice.

Part II: although a linear scan through the string now seemed the smarter (certainly faster) move, it seemed more interesting to expand on my part I solution: 3 regexes. Now I needed not just the matches, but also their string-index. Googled to find `re.finditer` which returns a so-called `Matching-object` which has `span/start/end`. First started to write a (manual) merge of the three lists of indexes, but resorted to iterating the `mult`-list, getting the maximum of smaller indexes of enable/disable-lists. This feels like O(n^2) and could easily be optimized...but it does the job.

### day 04

Part I: the naive solution: just get all possible lines (horizontal,vertical, diagonal in both directions) and use a regex to find matches in each line. It felt a bit tedious to get the diagonal lines (bookkeeping of indices), and got a flashback to [exercise percolation](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php) for the Coursera algorithms course.

Part II: feels easier than part I. Pondered to re-use part I by scanning only the diagonal lines and combining them on common 'A's. But the naive solution seemed much easier and faster: walk the grid, for each A just determine its cross en check if the cross-legs are both MAS or SAM.

### day 05

Part I: to save the relation (graph) in python it seems fit to use a dict with int-keys having int-valued set. It's unclear whether the relation is total order or merely a patial order, so I built a check for that while constructing. Turned out it is total, and the exercise is very easy using `sorted` with custom comparer-function.

Part II: a one-liner, given our setup in part I.

### day 06

Part I: a grid again! Time to abstract a grid object? Nah, not until the third time will we abstract a common pattern!

Pretty straightforward while-loop, updating the grid while advancing a step.

Part II: a loop is characterized by a coordinate which is visited twice in the same direction. Brute force: for each possible new obstruction, check if this yields a loop. This is the first puzzle where brute force is ... slow!
A simple optimisation is: only try obstacles on the path of the original grid. This still leaves 2 minutes of calculation. Since I am already falling way behind schedule, I will leave at that.

### day 07

Part I: to get all possible operator combinations, I used python itertools `product`. To compute the expression left-to-right, a simple recurive function did the job. But the calculation is not fast...

Part II: easy change, but it takes looooong to compute this part.

A very good optimisation is to start at the end, recursively applying inverse operators: subtract,quotient,string-split. These operators decrease the running result, and short circuit: if running result is negative, stop. Also, if the quotient is not an integer, you stop that branch. 

### day 08

Part I: gather all symbols (antennaTypes) in a dictionary, along with their coorinates. Use python `iterools.combinations` to get all distinct pairs, and easily calculate the coordinates on the line elements at distance 1.

Part II: a simple while-loop to account for all distances on the grid.
The only subtle change was to get the antennas themselves (start while-loop at 0 distance rather than 1).
